= jawn: jawn automates work now

Most people lead tremendously busy lives,  where they end up with a ton of https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-enduring-mystery-of-jawn-philadelphias-allpurpose-noun[jawn] to do. Personally, I got sick of doing so much by hand so I wrote `jawn` to help me deal with all my jawn. Hopefully this jawn, `jawn`, will help you.

== Theory of operation

The central element of `jawn` is the `Jawnfile`.  It contains a living definition of your jawn and serves as a catalog of jawn. If you have more jawn to do, add more jawn to the `Jawnfile`.

Jawn are expressed using a dead-simple DSL so straightforward, that even a Cowboys fan can figure it out. Each jawn in the `Jawnfile` is a single declaration followed by a newline. One line is one jawn.

Since `jawn` is written in Rust, it's actually quite performant and you'll notice `jawn` finishes almost instantaneously for workloads with less than 70-100 jawn.
